			   A study was carried out to determine how well the L-Galaxies 2020 semi-analytic
model simulates the stellar halos of galaxies and the intracluster stellar (ICS) components
of galaxy clusters. Two galaxy disruption models were tested, namely instantaneous
disruption and gradual disruption. Furthermore, two stellar halo profiles
were applied: a power-law with slope -3.5 and a
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. It was found that a combination of
an NFW profile and gradual disruption provided the best match to observations of stellar halo mass, total stellar
mass, stellar mass fractions, and stellar halo iron abundances. Gradual disruption
of satellite galaxies also resulted in the central galaxies having more massive stellar
halos. Additional stellar halo formation
mechanisms, such as in-situ star formation, were not needed, as the stellar halo
masses seen in observations can be obtained in L-Galaxies by considering only tidal
disruption of infalling satellite galaxies. The number of high mass accretions into the
halos of Milky Way-mass galaxies in the gradual disruption model agreed reasonably
well with simulation literature. It was found that while central galaxies can induce
many disruptions of satellite galaxies (over a thousand in some cases), the majority
of the Milky Way-sized stellar halos in L-Galaxies are formed from only one to eight
high-mass accretion events, and it is possible that a single satellite could contribute
to multiple events. A population of galaxies with unexpectedly
low stellar halo iron abundances was found. These were determined to be a result
of disruptions of high mass, low metallicity satellite galaxies. Furthermore, 
carbon was found to be the dominant element produced by
stellar halo stars for the majority of redshifts in most high mass central and satellite
galaxies, due mainly to winds from asymptotic giant branch stars. The relative contribution
of stellar halo stars was found to be minor, however, with circumgalactic medium
enrichment from halo stars in comparison to outflows from galactic stars being on
average <1%. For clusters with virial masses exceeding 1.6x10^14 Msun, the brightest
central galaxy and ICS (BCG+ICS) stars contained 42% of the total cluster stellar
iron content, while the fraction M+ICS/(M_ICS+M_BCG) was found to be 83%, both results
being in good agreement with observations.
